################################## Running In AWS With CloudFormation ##################################

= Introduction

The Ether Cattle Initiative has produced a set of CloudFormation templates for those wishing to run a master / replica geth cluster on AWS.
This document has three sections.
Section 1 is a simple walkthrough of how to deploy and manage a cluster.
Section 2 discusses the elements of the CloudFormation stack, and what happens under the hood.
Section 3 covers general troubleshooting of the cluster.

This document assumes a basic level of familiarity with AWS, and general systems administration skills.
