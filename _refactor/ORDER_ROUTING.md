# Order Routing and Network Conectivity 

Depth First search expands the nodes which were most recently added to the fringe first. Asssigning a constant
negative weight to all edges essentially allows to reduce the value of the most recently nodes by that constant,
making them the nodes with the minimum value in the fringe when using uniform cost search.

`dij = α, α < 0` where there is one node of target (e.g. German Compliance requirements)

assuming that:
`cij > 0 ` is the cost to go from node `i` to node `j`.


### Network Size as a Function:
