# Efficient gas calculation algorithm for EVM

This article describes how to efficiently calculate gas and check stack requirements for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) instructions.

## Instructions metadata

Let's start by defining some basic and universal instructions' parameters.

1. Base gas cost.

   This is the static gas cost of instructions. Some instructions may have \_additional\_ cost depending on their operand values and/or the environment â€” these have to be handled individually during the instruction execution. The \_final\_ cost is never less than the \_base\_ cost.

2. Stack height requirement.

   This is the minimum stack height (number of items on the stack) required prior to the instruction execution.

3. Stack height change.

   This is difference of the stack height before and after the instruction execution. Can be negative if the instruction pops more items than pushes.

Examples:

| opcode  | base gas cost | stack height requirement | stack height change |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| ADD     | 3             | 2                        | -1                  |
| EXP     | 50            | 2                        | -1                  |
| DUP4    | 3             | 4                        | 1                   |
| SWAP1   | 3             | 2                        | 0                   |
| ADDRESS | 2             | 0                        | 1                   |
| CALL    | 700           | 7                        | -6                  |

## Basic instruction blocks

A \_basic instruction block\_ is a sequence of "straight-line" instructions without jumps and jumpdests in the middle. Jumpdests are only allowed at the entry, jumps at the exit. Basic blocks are nodes in the \_control flow graph\_. See \[Basic Block\] in Wikipedia.

In EVM there are simple rules to identify basic instruction block boundaries:

1. A basic instruction block \_starts\_ right before:

   - the first instruction in the code,
   - \`JUMPDEST\` instruction.

2. A basic instruction block \_ends\_ after the "terminator" instructions:
   - \`JUMP\`,
   - \`JUMPI\`,
   - \`STOP\`,
   - \`RETURN\`,
   - \`REVERT\`,
   - \`SELFDESTRUCT\`.

A basic instruction block is a shortest sequence of instructions such that a basic block starts before the first instruction and ends after the last.

In some cases multiple of the above rules can apply to single basic instruction block boundary.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for calculating gas and checking stack requirements pre-computes the values for basic instruction blocks and during execution the checks are done only once per instruction block.

### Collecting requirements for basic blocks

For a basic block we need to collect the following information:

- total \*\*base gas cost\*\* of all instructions,
- the \*\*stack height required\*\* (the minimum stack height needed to execute all instructions in the block),
- the \*\*maximum stack height growth\*\* relative to the stack height at block start.

This is done as follows:

1. Split code into basic blocks.
2. For each basic block:

\`\`\`python
class Instruction:
    base\_gas\_cost = 0
    stack\_required = 0
    stack\_change = 0

class BasicBlock:
    base\_gas\_cost = 0
    stack\_required = 0
    stack\_max\_growth = 0

def collect\_basic\_block\_requirements(basic\_block):
    stack\_change = 0
    for instruction in basic\_block:
        basic\_block.base\_gas\_cost += instruction.base\_gas\_cost

        current\_stack\_required = instruction.stack\_required - stack\_change
        basic\_block.stack\_required = max(basic\_block.stack\_required, current\_stack\_required)

        stack\_change += instruction.stack\_change

        basic\_block.stack\_max\_growth = max(basic\_block.stack\_max\_growth, stack\_change)
\`\`\`

### Checking basic block requirements

During execution, before executing an instruction that starts a basic block, the basic block requirements must be checked.

\`\`\`python
class ExecutionState:
    gas\_left = 0
    stack = \[\]

def check\_basic\_block\_requirements(state, basic\_block):
    state.gas\_left -= basic\_block.base\_gas\_cost
    if state.gas\_left < 0:
        raise OutOfGas()

    if len(state.stack) < basic\_block.stack\_required:
        raise StackUnderflow()

    if len(state.stack) + basic\_block.stack\_max\_growth > 1024:
        raise StackOverflow()
\`\`\`

## Misc

### EVM may terminate earlier

Because requirements for a whole basic block are checked up front, the instructions that have observable external effects might not be executed although they would be executed if the gas counting would have been done per instruction. This is not a consensus issue because the execution terminates with a "hard" exception anyway (and all effects are reverted) but might produce unexpected traces or terminate with a different exception type.

### Current "gas left" value

In EVMJIT additional instructions that begin a basic block are \`GAS\` and any of the \_call\_ instructions. This is because these instructions need to know the precise \_gas left\_ counter value. However, in evmone this problem has been solved without additional blocks splitting by attaching the correction value to the mentioned instructions.

### Undefined instructions

Undefined instructions have base gas cost 0 and not stack requirements.
