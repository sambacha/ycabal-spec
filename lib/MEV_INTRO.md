> Profit, Exposure and the extent of penetration into the market

For fixed spread liquidations pro-tocols, such as Aave, Compound, and dYdX (66%
of the DeFi lendingmarket), we find that the past 16,031 liquidations yield an
accu-mulative profit of 20.18M USD over the entire existence of thoseprotocols
(19months). 28.80M USD over 2 years.

We find that 12.71% of these liquidationsback-run the price oracle
update transaction, while 87.29% attempt to front-run competing liquidators.

For arbitrage, we identify 789 smart contracts performing 51,415 trades, realizing a
total profitof 7.11M USD.

Expected Execution Price \(( E [P]):\) When a liquidity taker issues a trade on \(X / Y,\) the taker wishes to execute the trade with the expected execution price \(E [P]\) (based on the AMM algorithm and \(X / Y\) state) given the expected slippage.
Execution Price \((P):\) During the time difference between a liquidity taker issuing a transaction, and the transaction being executed (e.g. mined in a block), the state of the AMM market \(X / Y\) may change.
This state change may induce unexpected slippage resulting in an execution price \(P \neq E [P]\).
Unexpected Price Slippage \((P- E [P]):\) is the difference between \(P\) and \(E [P]\). Unexpected Slippage Rate \(\left(\frac{P- E [P]}{ E [P]}\right):\) is \(\quad\) the unexpected slippage over the expected price.

## DEX/AMM Parameters

### addLiquidity

AddLiquidity: A liquidity provider deposits
\begin{equation*} \delta\_{x} \end{equation*}
asset into the corresponding liquiditypools (cf. Equation 1).

\begin{equation*}
(x, y) \frac{\text { AddLiquidity }\left(\delta*{x}, \delta*{y}\right)}{\delta*{x} \in R ^{+}, \delta*{y} \in R ^{+}}\left(x+\delta*{x}, y+\delta*{y}\right)
\end{equation*}

### RemoveLiqujidity

RemoveLiquidity: A liquidity provider withdrawsδxofassetX, andδyof assetYfrom the correspondingliquidity pools (cf. Equation 2).

\begin{equation*}
(x, y) \frac{\text { RemoveLiquidity }\left(\delta*{x}, \delta*{y}\right)}{\delta*{x} \in R ^{+} \leq x, \delta*{y} \in R ^{+} \leq y}\left(x-\delta*{x}, y-\delta*{y}\right)
\end{equation*}

### TransferLiqudity

Definition 1.The state (or depth) of an AMM marketX/Yis defined as(x,y),x the amount of assetX,y the amount of assetY in the liquidity pool.
The state at a given blockchain blockN is denoted(xN,yN).AMM

DEXs support the following actions.

AddLiquidity: A liquidity provider deposits [δxof assetX], and δy of assetY into the corresponding liquidity pools.

(1)RemoveLiquidity:A liquidity provider withdrawsδxofassetX, andδyof assetYfrom the correspondingliquidity pools

TransactXforY: A liquidity taker can tradeδxof assetX, increasing the available liquidity of assetX, inexchange forδy=f(δx−cx(·))−cy(·) of assetY, decreasing the available liquidity of assetY(cf.Equation
3).cx(·),cy(·) represent the trade fees inassetXandYrespectively.f(·) calculates the amountof assetYpurchased by the liquidity taker. EachAMM exchange may chose a custom pricing functionf(·) for governing the asset exchange [1].
Note thatthe exchange asset pricing cannot be determined bya simple constant, as the market dynamics of pur-chasing and selling power must be modeled withinthe exchange (i.e. the more assets on would want topurchase, the higher the fees)

### TransactXforY

TransactXforY: A liquidity taker can tradeδxof assetX, increasing the available liquidity of assetX, in exchange  
\begin{equation*}
(x, y) \frac{\text { Transact } X \text { for } Y\left(\delta*{x}\right)}{\delta*{x} \in R ^{+}}\left(x+\delta*{x}, y-f\left(\delta*{x}-c*{x}(\cdot)\right)+c*{y}(\cdot)\right)
\end{equation*}

of assetY, decreasing the available liquidity of assetY(cf.Equation 3).cx(·),cy(·) represent the trade fees inassetXandYrespectively.f(·) calculates the amountof assetYpurchased by the liquidity taker. EachAMM exchange may chose a custom pricing functionf(·) for governing the asset exchange [1]. Note thatthe exchange asset pricing cannot be determined bya simple constant, as the market dynamics of pur-chasing and selling power must be modeled withinthe exchange (i.e. the more assets on would want topurchase, the higher the fees).

7, the trader executes the arbitrage in the following order:
WETH→BOXT→UNI→USDT→USDN→UNI→WETH. This arbitrage strategy consistsof two
triangular arbitrages:(i)WETH→BOXT→UNI→WETH;(ii)UNI→USDT→USDN→UNI

the trader first swaps400ETH for1040COMP on Uniswap v2, thenswaps1040COMP
for476ETH on Sushiswap, realizing a revenue of76ETH

### Arbitrage: Mainly Backrunning

If a transaction is a blockstate arbitrage, then the execution should remain
profitable. We findthat60.08%arbitrage transactions are no longer profitable,
whichindicates that these transactions likely perform back-running.

### Percentage of transactions that are privately broadcast

From block 11503300 (Dec-22-2020 12:39:48 PM +UTC) to 11548969 (Dec-29-2020
12:39:58 PM +UTC),
the chain recorded 8,285,218 transactions. When comparing those with the
transactions we ob-served on the network layer, we find that 136,143 mined
transactionswere not broadcast prior to being mined.
We hence can concludethat1.64% of the transactions are being privately.
