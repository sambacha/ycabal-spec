== About quality
The quality of a product or system is very generally called
_Set of properties or characteristics_ defined.

In practice, some categories (generic terms) have been used for frequently occurring _quality requirements_
(synonymous: quality goals) established, essentially shaped by the conceptual models of DIN / ISO 9126 and 25010.

=== The categories

* << changeability, changeability >>
* << usability, usability >>
* << efficiency, efficiency >>
* << reliability, reliability >>
* << operability, operability >>
* << other, other (including functionality) >>


=== Classification can be ambiguous

Some quality goals or requirements belong to several
"Generic terms" or categories - the assignment of the examples to
Because of this, we sometimes found categories or chapters difficult.

In case you have your specific quality requirements in the outline

=== Formulation of scenarios
A (quality) scenario describes the behavior (1) of a system (3)
when an event or stimulus occurs (2).

==== (1) Behavior of a system
The behavior can relate to software or hardware, or
also refer to the persons, roles or organizations involved.

Behavior should always be formulated _measurable or decidable_ in scenarios.

==== (2) Event or stimulus
A user initiates a function while working with the system, for example:

* selects a menu item / function
* clicks a button on a graphical user interface
* starts processing

A stakeholder changes something in the system, for example:

* modified source code or configuration of the system
* changes to the hardware of the system
* changes the deployment of the system

A stakeholder changes something in the processes or organizations involved.

==== (3) system
The term "system" is very broad here: This includes software,
Software components, involved hardware, networks, middleware, databases,
but also all the people, roles or organizations involved.
