= Design Goals

The primary goal of the Ether Cattle intiative is to provide access to Ethereum
RPC services with minimal operational complexity and cost.
Ideally this will be achieved by enhancing an existing Ethereum client with
capabilities that simplify the operational challenges.

== Health Checks

A major challenge with existing Ethereum nodes is evaluating the health of an
individual node.
Generally nodes should be considered healthy if they have the blockchain and
state trie at the highest block, and are able to serve RPC requests relating to
that state.
If a node is more than a couple of blocks behind the network, it should be
considered unhealthy.


== Service Initialization

One of the major challenges with treating Ethereum nodes as disposable is the
initialization time.
Conventionally a new instance must find peers, download the latest blocks from
those peers, and validate each transaction in those blocks.
Even if the instance is built from a relatively recent snapshot, this can be a
bandwidth intensive, computationally intensive, disk intensive, and time
consuming process.

In a trustless peer-to-peer system, these steps are unavoidable.
Malicious peers could provide incorrect information, so it is necessary to
validate all of the information received from untrusted peers.
But given several nodes managed by the same operator, it is generally safe for
those nodes to trust eachother, allowing individual nodes to avoid some of the
computationally intensive and disk intensive steps that make the initialization
process time consuming.

Ideally node snapshots will be taken periodically, new instances will launch
based on the most recent available snapshot, and then sync the blockchain and
state trie from trusted peers without having to validate every successive
transaction.
Assuming relatively recent snapshots are available, this should allow new
instances to start up in a matter of minutes rather than hours.

Additionally, during the initialization process services should be identifiable
as still initializing and excluded from the load balancer pool.
This will avoid nodes serving outdated information during initialization.


== Load Balancing

Given reliable healthchecks and a quick initialization process, one challenge
remains on loadbalancing.
The Ethereum RPC protocol supports a concept of "filter subscriptions" where a
filter is installed on an Ethereum node and subsequent requests about the
subscription are served updates about changes matching the filter since the
previous request.
This requires a stateful session, which depends on having a single Ethereum node
serve each successive request relating to a specific subscription.

For now this can be addressed on the client application using `+Provider
Engine's Filter Subprovider
<https://github.com/MetaMask/provider-engine/blob/master/subproviders/filters.js>+`
The Filter Subprovider mimics the functionality of installing a filter on a node
and requesting updates about the subscription by making a series of stateless
calls against the RPC server.
Over the long term it might be beneficial to add a shared database that would
allow the load balanced RPC nodes to manage filters on the server side instead
of the client side, but due to the existence of the Filter Subprovider that is
not necessary in the short term.


== Reduced Computational Requirements

As discussed in :ref:``initialization``, a collection of nodes managed by a
single operator do not have the same trust model amongst themselves as nodes in
a fully peer-to-peer system.
RPC Nodes can potentially decrease their computational overhead by relying on a
subset of the nodes within a group to validate transactions.
This would mean that a small portion of nodes would need the computational
capacity to validate every transaction, while the remaining nodes would have
lower resource requirements to serve RPC requests, allowing flexible scaling and
redundancy.
