= Operational Requirements


== Developer Notice

!!! note 
> Testing Documents are Broken into their relevent sections, this is a general overview
of the Implementation as it relates specifically to the Geth (go-ethereum) client only



The implementation discussed in previous sections relates directly to the software changes required to help operationalize Ethereum clients.
There are also ongoing operational processes that will be required to maintain a cluster of master / replica nodes.


{cluster-initialization}

== Cluster Initialization

Initializing a cluster comprised of a master and one or more replicas requires a few steps.

=== Master initialization 

Before standing up any replicas or configuring the master to send logs to Kafka, the master should be synced with the blockchain.
In most circumstances, this should be a typical Geth fast sync with standard garbage collection arguments.


{_leveldb-snapshots}

== LevelDB Snapshotting 

Once the master is synced, the LevelDB directory needs to be snapshotted.
This will become the basis of both the subsequent master and the replica servers.

===  Replication Master Configuration 

Once synced and ready for replication, the master needs to be started with the garbage collection mode of "archive".
Without the "archive" garbage collection mode, the state trie is kept in memory, and not written to either LevelDB or Kafka immediately.
If state data is not written to Kafka immediately, the replicas have only the chain data and cannot do state lookups.
The master should also be configured with a Kafka broker and topic for logging write operations.

== Replica Configuration

Replicas should be created with a copy of the LevelDB database snapshotted in :ref:``leveldb-snapshots``.
When executed, the replica service should be pointed to the same Kafka broker and topic as the master.
Any changes written by the master since the LevelDB snapshot will be pulled from Kafka before the Replica starts serving HTTP requests.

=== Periodic Replica Snapshots

When new replicas are scaled up, they will connect to Kafka to pull any changes not currently reflected in their local database.
The software manages this by storing the Kafka offset of each write operation as it persists to LevelDB, and when a new replica starts up it will replay any write operations more recent than the offset of the last saved operation.
However this assumes that Kafka will have the data to resume from that offset, and in practice Kafka periodically discards old data.
Without intervention, a new replica will eventually spin up to find that Kafka no longer has the data required for it to resume.

The solution for this is fairly simple.
We need to snapshot the replicas more frequently than Kafka fully cycles out data.
Each snapshot should reflect the latest data in Kafka at the time the snapshot was taken, and any new replicas created from that snapshot will be able to resume so long as Kafka still has the offset from the time the snapshot was taken.

The mechanisms for taking snapshots will depend on operational infrastructure.
The implementation will vary between cloud providers or on-premises infrastructure management tools, and will be up to each team to implement (though we may provide additional documentation and tooling for specific providers).

Administrators should be aware of Kafka's retention period, and be sure that snapshots are taken more frequently than the retention period, leaving enough time to troubleshoot failed snapshots before Kafka runs out

=== Periodic Cluster Refreshes

Because replication requires the master to write to LevelDB with a garbage collection mode of "archive", the disk usage for each node of a cluster can grow fairly significantly after the initial sync.
When disk usage begins to become a problem, the entire cluster can be refreshed following the :ref:``cluster-initialization`` process.

Both clusters can run concurrently while the second cluster is brought up, but it is important that the two clusters use separate LevelDB snapshots and separate Kafka partitions to stay in sync (they can use the same Kafka broker, if it is capable of handling the traffic).

As replicas for the new cluster are spun up, they will only start serving HTTP requests once they are synced with their respective Kafka partition.
Assuming your load balancer only attempts to route requests to a service once it has passed health checks, both clusters can co-exist behind the load balancer concurrently.

=== Multiple Clusters

Just as multiple clusters can co-exist during a refresh, multiple clusters can co-exist for stability purposes.
Within a single cluster, the master server is a single point of failure.
If the master gets disconnected from its peers or fails for other reasons, its peers will not get updates and become stale.
A new master can be created from the last LevelDB snapshot, but that will take time during which the replicas will be stale.

With multiple clusters, when a master is determined to be unhealthy its replicas could be removed from the load balancer to avoid stale data, and additional clusters could continue to serve current data.

=== High Availability

A single cluster provides several operational benefits over running conventional Ethereum nodes, but the master server is still a single point of failure.
Using data stored in Kafka, the master can recover much more quickly than a node that needed to sync from peers, but that can still lead to a period of time where the replicas are serving stale data.

To achieve high availability requires multiple clusters with independent masters and their own replicas.
Multiple replica clusters can share a high-availability Kafka cluster.
The following formula can be used to determine the statistical availability of a cluster:


math:: a = 1 - (1 - \frac\{mtbf}{mttr + mtbf}){caret}N

Where:

* `mtbf` - Mean Time Between Failures - The average amount of time between failures of a master server
* `mttr` - Mean Time To Recovery - The average amount of time it takes to replace a master server after a failure
* `N` - The number of independently operating clusters

The values of `mtbf` and `mttr` will depend on your operational environment.
With our AWS CloudFormation templates, we have established an `mttr` of 45 minutes when snapshotting daily.
We have not gathered enough data to establish a mtbf, but with two independent clusters and a 45 minute `mttr`, EC2's regional SLA becomes the bounding factor of availability if the `mtbf` is greater than two weeks.

This formula focuses only on the availability of masters - it assumes that each master has multiple independent replicas.
If a master only has a single replica, that will hurt the `mtbf` of the cluster as a whole.
