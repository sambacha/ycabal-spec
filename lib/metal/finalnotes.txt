Upgrade Process
===============

Upgrading an Ether Cattle cluster should be handled carefully to avoid
inconsistencies between the master and replica servers.

We recommend an immutable server approach for both masters and replicas. Rather
than updating the server in place, stand up a new server, let it sync, and then
take down the old server. Note that you should not have two masters running for
the same cluster at the same time, so this may involve some downtime.

When upgrading geth, we recommend standing up a whole new cluster with a new
Kafka topic. Using the most recent snapshot from your old cluster, stand up a
new set of masters and replicas with the new version of geth, communicating over
a new topic. Once the new replicas are synced and joined to your load balancer,
you can take down the old replicas. This approach avoids any service downtime.

Disk Considerations
===================

Because the master server must run in archival mode, its disk utilization grows
faster than a typical geth server - generally around 25 GB per week. To keep
disk consumption from getting out of hand, you may want to periodically rerun
the Getting an Initial Snapshot process and creating a new cluster from that
snapshot. This should get you back to the base level of disk usage for a fast
synced node, which, at the time of this writing, is around 200 GB.
